    "The keyword def introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function’s documentation string, or docstring. (More about docstrings can be found in the section Documentation Strings.) There are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation, or to let the user interactively browse through code; it’s good practice to include docstrings in code that you write, so make a habit of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables and variables of enclosing functions cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless, for global variables, named in a global statement, or, for variables of enclosing functions, named in a nonlocal statement), although they may be referenced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the called function when it is called; thus, arguments are passed using call by value (where the value is always an object reference, not the value of the object). 1 When a function calls another function, or calls itself recursively, a new local symbol table is created for that call.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function definition associates the function name with the function object in the current symbol table. The interpreter recognizes the object pointed to by that name as a user-defined function.

In fact, even functions without a return statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring one. This value is called None (it’s a built-in name). Writing the value None is normally suppressed by the interpreter if it would be the only value written. You can see it if you really want to using print():\n",

    "\n",
    "    The statement result.append(a) calls a method of the list object result. A method is a function that ‘belongs’ to an object and is named obj.methodname, where obj is some object (this may be an expression), and methodname is the name of a method that is defined by the object’s type. Different types define different methods. Methods of different types may have the same name without causing ambiguity. (It is possible to define your own object types and methods, using classes, see Classes) The method append() shown in the example is defined for list objects; it adds a new element at the end of the list. In this example it is equivalent to result = result + [a], but more efficient.\n",

    "It is also possible to define functions with a variable number of arguments. There are three forms, which can be combined.\n",
    "4.8.1. Default Argument Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments. This creates a function that can be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to allow. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def ask_ok(prompt, retries=4, reminder='Please try again!'):\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        ok = input(prompt)\n",

    "        if ok in ('n', 'no', 'nop', 'nope'):\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "        retries = retries - 1\n",
    "        if retries < 0:\n",
    "            raise ValueError('invalid user response')\n",
    "        print(reminder)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function can be called in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    giving only the mandatory argument: ask_ok('Do you really want to quit?')\n",
    "\n",
    "    giving one of the optional arguments: ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    or even giving all arguments: ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2, 'Come on, only yes or no!')\n",
    "\n",
    "This example also introduces the in keyword. This tests whether or not a sequence contains a certain value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default values are evaluated at the point of function definition in the defining scope, so that\n",
    "\n",
    "i = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "def f(arg=i):\n",

    "\n",
    "i = 6\n",
    "f()\n",
    "\n",
    "will print 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important warning: The default value is evaluated only once. This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. For example, the following function accumulates the arguments passed to it on subsequent calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "def f(a, L=[]):\n",

    "\n",
    "[1]\n",
    "[1, 2]\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, you can write the function like this instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "def f(a, L=None):\n",
    "    if L is None:\n",
    "        L = []\n",

    "Functions can also be called using keyword arguments of the form kwarg=value. For instance, the following function:\n",

    "parrot('a million', 'bereft of life', 'jump')         # 3 positional arguments\n",
    "parrot('a thousand', state='pushing up the daisies')  # 1 positional, 1 keyword\n",

    "parrot(110, voltage=220)     # duplicate value for the same argument\n",
    "parrot(actor='John Cleese')  # unknown keyword argument\n",
    "\n",
    "In a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments. All the keyword arguments passed must match one of the arguments accepted by the function (e.g. actor is not a valid argument for the parrot function), and their order is not important. This also includes non-optional arguments (e.g. parrot(voltage=1000) is valid too). No argument may receive a value more than once. Here’s an example that fails due to this restriction:\n",

Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression. Semantically, they are just syntactic sugar for a normal function definition. Like nested function definitions, lambda functions can reference variables from the containing scope:\n",

    "The first line should always be a short, concise summary of the object’s purpose. For brevity, it should not explicitly state the object’s name or type, since these are available by other means (except if the name happens to be a verb describing a function’s operation). This line should begin with a capital letter and end with a period.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Python parser does not strip indentation from multi-line string literals in Python, so tools that process documentation have to strip indentation if desired. This is done using the following convention. The first non-blank line after the first line of the string determines the amount of indentation for the entire documentation string. (We can’t use the first line since it is generally adjacent to the string’s opening quotes so its indentation is not apparent in the string literal.) Whitespace “equivalent” to this indentation is then stripped from the start of all lines of the string. Lines that are indented less should not occur, but if they occur all their leading whitespace should be stripped. Equivalence of whitespace should be tested after expansion of tabs (to 8 spaces, normally).\n",
