    "    Open a terminal window and type crontab -e to open the crontab editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The first time you run crontab -e, you may be prompted to choose an editor. Select your preferred editor (e.g. nano, vim, etc.) and press Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once the editor opens, you can add your CRON job to the bottom of the file. The syntax for a CRON job is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "    * * * * * /path/to/command arg1 arg2\n",
    "\n",
    "    The five asterisks represent the minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week that the command should run. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example, * * * * * \n",
    "    means the command will run eevery hour overy minute of f every day. You can replace the asterisks \n",
    "    with specific values or ranges (e.g. 0 6 * * 1-5 means the command will run at 6:00 AM on weekdays).\n",
    "\n",
    "    The /path/to/command represents the path to the script or command you want to run, and arg1 arg2 represent any arguments the command requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once you have added your CRON job to the file, save and exit the editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To verify that your CRON job has been added, type crontab -l to list all the CRON jobs associated with your user account."
