    "#### Introduction\n",
    "I'm Amit Shukla, and I specialize in training neural networks for finance supply chain analysis, enabling them to identify data patterns and make accurate predictions.\n",
    "During the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I successfully trained GL and Supply Chain neural networks to anticipate supply chain shortages. The valuable insights gained from this effort have significantly influenced the content of this tutorial series.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "By delving into this powerful tool, we will master the fundamental techniques of ETL Datawarehouse and ELT Data Lakes. This knowledge is crucial in preparing finance and supply chain data for advanced analytics, visualization, and predictive modeling using neural networks and machine learning.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### Subject\n",
    "It's important to note that this particular series will concentrate solely on `Datawarehouse and Data Lake`. \n",
    "Throughout this series, our main focus will be on learning `ETL DW and ELT Data Lakes`.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### Following\n",
    "However, in future installments, we will explore Data Analytics and delve into the realm of machine learning for predictive analytics.\n",
    "\tThank you for joining me, and I'm excited to embark on this educational journey together.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Let's get started.\n",
