For example, * * * * * means the command will run every minute of every hour of every day. You can replace the asterisks with specific values or ranges (e.g. 0 6 * * 1-5 means the command will run at 6:00 AM on weekdays).\n",

    "    The /path/to/command represents the path to the script or command you want to run, and arg1 arg2 represent any arguments the command requires.\n",

    "\n",
    "    To verify that your CRON job has been added, type crontab -l to list all the CRON jobs associated with your user account."
