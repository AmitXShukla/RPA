    "## Introduction\n",
    "I'm Amit Shukla, and I specialize in training neural networks for finance supply chain analysis, enabling them to identify data patterns and make accurate predictions.\n",
    "During the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I successfully trained GL and Supply Chain neural networks to anticipate supply chain shortages. The valuable insights gained from this effort have significantly influenced the content of this tutorial series.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "By delving into this powerful tool, we will master the fundamental techniques of Data Wrangling. This knowledge is crucial in preparing finance and supply chain data for advanced analytics, visualization, and predictive modeling using neural networks and machine learning.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### Subject\n",
    "It's important to note that this particular series will concentrate solely on `Data Wrangling`. \n",
    "Throughout this series, our main focus will be on learning `Rust Polars Data Frame Python library`.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### Following\n",
    "However, in future installments, we will explore Data Analytics and delve into the realm of machine learning for predictive analytics.\n",
    "\tThank you for joining me, and I'm excited to embark on this educational journey together.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Let's get started."

    "## Why another DataFrame\n",
    "---\n",
    "Despite the numerous state-of-the-art dataframe packages available in the market, the Polar dataframe, which is built on RUST, boasts the fastest execution speed, enabling it to handle complex data science operations on tabular datasets.\n",

    "- Automatic Optimization\n",
    "- Embarrassingly Parallel\n",
    "- Easy to learn consistent, predictable API that has strict schema\n",
    "- SQLs like expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficient Execution of Analytics on Large-than-Memory (RAM) Data\n",
    "\n",
    "RAM is not a big deal these days as most computers and VMs offer inexpensive GBs of RAM. In fact, the availability of affordable RAM is the primary reason why Pandas-like DataFrames remain the go-to choice, and it is unlikely that Pandas or R Tables will become obsolete anytime soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Polars DataFrames are increasingly gaining popularity among developers due to their ability to harness the horsepower of Apache Spark, the backend support of DuckDB and Apache Arrow, and the ease-of-use of Pandas-like data frame functionalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Polars comes with built-in multi-core, multi-threaded parallel processing, making it a highly preferred choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lazy API vs Eager execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Just because an API is referred to as \"lazy\" does not necessarily imply that there will be a delay in processing or execution, and conversely, \"eager\" execution doesn't necessarily mean that the programming language will process data transformations or begin execution immediately and more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, using a Lazy API implies that the API will first take the time to optimize the query before execution, which often results in improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this concept, consider running SQL on an RDBMS database. If the statistics, indexes, and data partitions have been appropriately optimized and the SQL is written in an optimized manner that utilizes the available statistics, indexes, and data partitions, the results will be delivered more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automatic Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn few automation techniques to efficiently optimize queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Embarrassingly Parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Easy to learn consistent, predictable API that has strict schema\n",

    "It serves as the blueprint for how financial data is collected, stored, processed, and analyzed, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and efficiency in managing financial operations. \n",

    "\n",
    "It typically encompasses multiple dimensions, including time, currency, and geographical locations, chart of accounts, departments / cost centers, fiscal years and reporting accounting periods providing a holistic view of the organization's financial landscape. \n",
    "\n",
    "A well-designed finance data model is critical for generating accurate financial reports, facilitating financial planning and forecasting, and supporting strategic decision-making at all levels of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, since our objective is learn Data Science operations on Finance and Supply chain dataset, we will focus on creating\n",

    "It encompasses critical components such as customers, orders, receipts, products, invoices, vouchers, and ship-to locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Customers form the foundation of the supply chain, as they drive demand for products. Orders and receipts represent the flow of goods and services, capturing the movement of inventory throughout the supply chain. \n",
