    "Meta has recently released Llama 2, a large language model trained with up to 70B parameters, positioning it as the fastest and most advanced solution available. This model is expected to outperform other tools in terms of both speed and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, I will demonstrate some automation use cases I have been working on. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that these use cases/models will work best when trained on \"in-house\" data. However, training such models is a rigorous task that requires significant computing hours and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things more accessible and easier to utilize in production, using \"off the shelf\", language models like ChatGPT and Llama 2 is a viable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I present some examples of use cases I've been working on. \n",
    "\n",
    "*While these examples are not meant for production*, they still showcase the powerful capabilities of the language models.\n",

    "#### About me\n",
    "I'm Amit Shukla, and I specialize in training neural networks for Finance Supply Chain analysis, enabling them to identify data patterns and make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I successfully trained GL and Supply Chain neural networks to anticipate supply chain shortages. The valuable insights gained from this effort have significantly influenced the content of this tutorial series.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "By delving into this powerful tool, we will master the fundamental techniques of utilizing large language models to predict hazards. \n",
    "This knowledge is crucial in preparing finance and supply chain data for advanced analytics, visualization, and predictive modeling using neural networks and machine learning.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### Subject\n",
    "It is crucial to emphasize that this specific series will focus exclusively on presenting `production-like examples that demonstrate certain use cases`. It is not intended for production applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, these examples illustrate highly potent techniques that have practical applications in real-world Data Analytics.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### Following\n",
    "In future installments, we will explore Data Analytics and delve into the realm of Data Analytics and machine learning for predictive analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for joining me, and I'm excited to embark on this educational journey together.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Let's get started.\n",
